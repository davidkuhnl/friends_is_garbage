  <!-- 
  Head tag
  ----------------------
  - this is something like a configuration section for your page.
  - you set your meta tags here which are used to tell search engines and browsers what your page is and such, you don't really have to worry about them too much.
  - you point the HTML to the javascript and css files. Those can be both local or remote/online

	<!-- 
	Script and style references
	---------------------------
	- here you point to all the scripts and styles you want to use in the page
	- it doesn't matter if you load first CSS or javascript but the orger within those groups matters
		- Bootstrap for instance uses jQuery, so you have to load jQuery before Bootstrap
		- basically you just follow the dependency chan from the most general ones to the specific ones
		- your local scripst conatining your specific functions should be loaded the last
	-->
	
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" />

    <!-- jQuery first, then Bootstrap JS -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

    <!-- 
	Local scripts
		- those are the ones you define yourself and that are part of your project
		- the paths are relative to the location of the html file
	-->
    <script src="./js/main.js" ></script>

    <!-- Local CSS - same as the scripts	-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/main.css" />

	<!-- This is what is going to be displayed in the browser tab and such.	-->
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>


  <!-- 
  Body tag
  ----------------------
	- this is where the actual content of your page goes
  -->
  <body>

  <!-- 
	- There's tons of tags in html each with different purpose, some of the most useful ones are:
		- <div></div> - allows you to wrap content into a block so you can style it and reference it
		- <span></span> - similar to div but has inline properties, it's more for when you want to wrap part of text or something to be able to change it's color, size, etc.
		- <table>
			<tr>
				<td>row 1; cell 1</td>
				<td>row 1; cell 2</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>row 2; cell 1</td>
				<td>row 2; cell 2</td>
			</tr>
		</table> - creates a simple table of an arbitrary amount of rows and colums. But it actually easier to use bootstrap for the same bahavior.
		
		<a href='some_url'>Link somewhere</a> creates link to whatever address
		
		<h1></h1>
		<h2></h2>
		<h3></h3>
		<h4></h4> - headings, you can style them however you want
		
		<ul>
			<li> List item 1 </li>
			<li> List item 2 </li>
		</ul> 	- for lists
		
	- each tag can have multiple attributes with multiple values
		- those are used to say how the tag looks and behaves or to set its identifiers so you can refer to it in your scripts and styles
		- the most important ones are:
			- id - it's just unique identifier of that tag, there shouldn't be multiple tads with the same ID on one page
			- class - also identifier but there can be multiple tags with the same class. It then allows you to refer to multiple tags at once if you for example want to change color of all of them or something.
				- one tag can have multiple classes; they are just separated by space
			
		- bootstrap uses classes to style your page
  -->
   

  <!-- The actual content  -->
  
  <!-- 
  I usually use the bootstrap grid system to organize the things on the page.  
  
  It works like this:
	- you start with div with class container-fluid
	- inside the container you can define as many rows as you want by using <div class="row"> </div>
	- inside each rows, you can have multiple columns defined using <div class="col"> </div>
	- inside each column you could further have multiple rows and so on so on
	
	- you can use bootstrap predefined style to alter how big the columns should be or how should the containers be aligned, it is all documented in the bootsrap docs.
